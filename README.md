## Project Overview

OpenBiz (OpenBizz) is a web-based Supply Chain Management System (SCMS) designed to integrate both upstream and downstream supply chains using open standards and technologies. It provides a customizable solution for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to manage procurement, inventory, sales, and logistics efficiently.

The system allows administrators to manage the supply chain via a web interface, while customers and suppliers can interact with the system through web services, enabling seamless order placement and invoice management without directly accessing the platform. Additionally, an Android sub-system supports warehouse operations, including barcode scanning for real-time inventory management.

---

## Features

- **User Registration & Authentication:** Secure registration and login for multiple user roles (admin, supplier, customer).
- **Procurement Management:** Enables purchasing, sourcing, and replenishment of goods.
- **Inventory Management:** Real-time tracking and updating of stock levels across warehouses.
- **Order Processing:** Place, approve, ship, and track orders with payment processing integration.
- **Collaboration Tools:** Facilitate communication and coordination among supply chain stakeholders.
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Ensures only authorized users can make system changes.
- **Web Service Integration:** Allows external systems to interact and automate supply chain operations.
- **Warehouse Management:** Barcode scanning and mobile access for warehouse staff.
- **Reporting & Analytics:** *(Planned)* Insights into supply chain efficiency, sales, and inventory.

---

## System Architecture

The system is built using a modular approach and follows the Iterative Waterfall software development methodology. Main technologies include:

- **Backend:** .NET (C#), SQL Server
- **Frontend:** JavaScript, LESS, HTML, CSS
- **Mobile:** Android (for warehouse module)
- **Web Services:** RESTful APIs for integration with customers and suppliers

> For diagrams (Use Case, Class, Sequence, Activity, Collaboration, Deployment), see `/docs` or project documentation.
